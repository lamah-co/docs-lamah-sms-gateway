## Request Format

Download the latest Postman Collection that mirrors these endpoints:

- `api-reference/openapi.json` (Postman collection format)

Import it into Postman to explore, test, and generate client code. All examples in this documentation use realistic Libyan phone numbers in international format (e.g., `+218912345678`).
